# The MIMIC database in ICD-11

Four sources of mappings have been used:
- The General Equivalence Mappings Table (GEMt) developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) establishes mappings between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.
- The mapping tables established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) between ICD-10 and ICD-11 (WHOt).[33]
- The mapping tables (Fungt) established between the frequently used ICD-10-CM codes found in Medicare claims data and their corresponding codes in the ICD-11 classification system by Fung et al. 
- The Unified Medical Language system (UMLS) is used to generate mappings between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.
